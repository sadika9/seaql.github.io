# Tutorial & Examples

If you prefer step-by-step tutorials on how to use SeaORM, you can checkout our [SeaORM Tutorials](https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-tutorial/).

It's a good idea to have a grasp of the basic concepts first, so let's continue.

If you are so eager and want something grab-and-go, SeaQL maintains a set of official examples contributed by the community (we welcome more!):

If you are building a web API that perform selecting nested relation extensively. Consider serving a GraphQL server instead. [seaography](https://github.com/SeaQL/seaography) is a GraphQL framework for building GraphQL resolvers using SeaORM entities. With GraphQL resolver in place select above nested relation is straightforward and easy. Check "[Getting Started with Seaography](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2022-09-27-getting-started-with-seaography/#query-data-via-graphql)" to learn more.

You can also check [SeaORM Cookbook](https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-cookbook/) for frequently asked questions and the best practice of SeaORM.
